\chapter{Project History}
\label{cha:appendix}
In the beginning of the project, we wanted to analyze Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow is one of the biggest Q\&A pages of the today’s web and the flagship of the Stack Exchange Network.
Our goal was to get high-quality insights into trending topics of developers around the globe.
After identifying current hot topics people write about, we wanted to search Twitter messages for the same topics. As a result, we wanted to find out if it is possible to discover trends we identified on Stack Overflow also on Twitter. In the next step, we wanted to categorize and analyze detected intersection on both media platforms. The project was supposed to answer among other possible questions the following ones:
Is Twitter used to ask questions?
Is there a chronological difference between the uprising of a trend on Stack Overflow and Twitter?
Are there opinion leaders in one of the sources? [People who ask a lot of questions / tweet a lot about a topic]

After a renewed validation of the project’s purpose we shifted the direction. We had the assumption that we would find only a few intersections between topics discussed on Stack Overflow and Twitter, if any. Additionally, Stack Overflow already offers quite sophisticated statistics about its data, including topics. These statistics make an own analysis redundant.

As a consequence, we changed the project’s objective, which is depicted in the following.
