\label{cha:conclusion-future-work}
Big social data analysis has grown into a serious business over the past several years with important use cases not just for research projects, but also in commercial products. Social Data analysis techniques are applied to predict terrorist attacks, stock performance, election results or the spread of diseases. Further, it is utilized by companies to analyze their customer’s satisfaction and the public opinion about their products. Cutting edge machine learning, natural language processing and data mining technologies are necessary to gain valuable insights into large amounts of social content.

We built an architecture to detect trends on Twitter. The detection based on the hashtags and user mentions occurring in the tweets belonging to the respective trend.
We used several techniques to process the data, such as Natural Language Processing, data mining and machine learning. By using stemming, stop word removal and building bags of words, we increased the process-ability of the collected data. With topic modeling we were able to get insights into relevant subjects that were not directly detectable. \todo{Hier evtl. über neuronales netzwerk schreiben}

In future work the sources to perform NLP could be extended, the parameters for topic modeling optimized and the neuronal network even better trained. Furthermore, it could be investigated whether other data besides hashtags and user mentions could be used as features to detect trends on Twitter.
